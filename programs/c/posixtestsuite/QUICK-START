QUICK-START
***********

So you're in a hurry and don't feel like reading all those docs in the Documentation section that we have worked so hard to write huh?  

No worries! Here's a quick doc to help you around POSIX** Test Suite.

========================
Setting up your machine
========================

* There is nothing to install, the suite is intended to be run directly.

* See the "BUILD" file for info on how to set up the Makefile and your developer machine,  
depending on what specific area you are concentrating on. 
(Signals, Semaphores, Threads, Timers or Message Qs).  

* "LDFLAGS" is a file used by the Makefile to link to what you specify in it. e.g. if you want to link with lpthread, you would open LDFLAGS and insert the line "-lpthread".  LDFLAGS has a few
simple examples contained in it.

===================
Running the tests
===================

* Easiest way to run all the tests is to do a "make" in the top-level directory.

* To run tests for a specific directory, first export the POSIX_TARGET variable
to the directory you want, then perform a "make".  e.g.:
	# export POSIX_TARGET=conformance/interfaces/pthread_create 
	# make

* An easy way to run all tests specific to your area of focus, run:

	# ./run_tests [MEM|MSG|SEM|SIG|THR|TMR|TPS]
	the argument is the 3 letter POSIX abbreviation for area

* For additional information on how to build and run the tests in this
suite, see Documentation/HOWTO_RunTests.

The following files give developers information on how to write test
cases for the project (under Documentation):

HOWTO_Assertions    	- describes format of the assertions files used to
                       	map test case descriptions to test cases
HOWTO_BoundaryTest    	- information about testing boundary conditions
HOWTO_CodingGuidelines	- describes coding guidelines for this project
HOWTO_Coverage        	- describes format of COVERAGE.<area> files
HOWTO_DefinitionsTest 	- ideas behind testing POSIX header files
HOWTO_ResultCodes     	- standardized return codes for tests
HOWTO_Tagging         	- describes how to tag files for inclusion in a release
