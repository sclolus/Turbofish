# Wolf3d

a 42 project : "_This project is inspired by the world-famous eponymous 90’s game, which
was the first FPS ever. It will enable you to explore ray-casting. Your goal will be to
make a dynamic view inside a maze, in which you’ll have to find your way_"

I added portals, portal gun and turret for the fun.

to test it : 
	git clone https://github.com/vcombey/wolfportal.git ~/wolfportal
    cd ~/wolfportal
    make
    ./wolf3d maps/portal_map

Controls :
z: orange portal;
s: blue portal;
directional pad;
