///  [XSI] [Option Start] If the parent process of the calling process
///  has set its SA_NOCLDWAIT flag or has set the action for the
///  SIGCHLD signal to SIG_IGN:
///
///      The process' status information (see Status Information), if
///      any, shall be discarded.
///
///      The lifetime of the calling process shall end immediately. If
///      SA_NOCLDWAIT is set, it is implementation-defined whether a
///      SIGCHLD signal is sent to the parent process.
///
///      If a thread in the parent process of the calling process is
///      blocked in wait(), waitpid(), or waitid(), and the parent
///      process has no remaining child processes in the set of
///      waited-for children, the wait(), waitid(), or waitpid()

///      The process' lifetime shall end once its parent obtains the
///      process' status information via a currently-blocked or future

///
///      If one or more threads in the parent process of the calling
///      process is blocked in a call to wait(), waitid(), or
///      waitpid() awaiting termination of the process, one (or, if

///      these threads shall obtain the process' status information as

///  [XSI] [Option Start] Each attached shared-memory segment is
///  detached and the value of shm_nattch (see shmget()) in the data

///  If the process is a controlling process, the SIGHUP signal shall
///  be sent to each process in the foreground process group of the

///  If the process is a controlling process, the controlling terminal
///  associated with the session shall be disassociated from the
///  session, allowing it to be acquired by a new controlling process.

///  If the exit of the process causes a process group to become
///  orphaned, and if any member of the newly-orphaned process group
///  is stopped, then a SIGHUP signal followed by a SIGCONT signal
///  shall be sent to each process in the newly-orphaned process
///  group.

///  All open named semaphores in the calling process shall be closed
///  as if by appropriate calls to sem_close().
///
///  [ML] [Option Start] Any memory locks established by the process
///  via calls to mlockall() or mlock() shall be removed. If locked
///  pages in the address space of the calling process are also mapped
///  into the address spaces of other processes and are locked by
///  those processes, the locks established by the other processes
///  shall be unaffected by the call by this process to _Exit() or
///  _exit(). [Option End]

///  Memory mappings that were created in the process shall be
///  unmapped before the process is destroyed.

///  [TYM] [Option Start] Any blocks of typed memory that were mapped

///  canceled. Those asynchronous I/O operations that are not canceled
///  shall complete as if the _Exit() or _exit() operation had not yet
///  occurred, but any associated signal notifications shall be

///  such I/O completion. Whether any I/O is canceled, and which I/O
